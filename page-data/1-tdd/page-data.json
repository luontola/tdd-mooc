One of the books said that this is how you write programs: <em>You take the input tape, look at its contents, and type manually the output tape that you expect to create. Then programming is the process of writing a program until the actual output tape matches the expected output tape.</em></p><p>Some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. And for two decades, the technique passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it was rediscovered.</p><p>Fast forward to 1990s. Kent Beck had followed in his father's footsteps and was now a software consultant. He had written the first unit testing framework in the xUnit family, SUnit for Smalltalk. It was then that Kent remembered the book he had read as a kid. <em>\"If I took this type-the-output-tape-first schema seriously, then I would write the test before I had the code.\"</em></p><p>He thought the idea was stupid, so he had to try it.</p><p>Kent tried it with a stack, and half an hour later he was hooked. All the anxieties he had felt while programming, which had been getting worse as experience accrued, just dropped away. <em>\"I'm not done until all the tests that I can imagine are all passing. But I don't have to make them all pass at once. I can just type one in and then make it work. And type the next one and make that work. Eventually... can I think of any other tests? No. I must be done.\"</em> He was completely relaxed.\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tM1iOJsR7p4?t=2080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[2]</a>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cGuTmOUdFbo?t=325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[3]</a></p><h2 id=\"what-is-tdd\" style=\"position:relative;\">What is TDD<a href=\"#what-is-tdd\" aria-label=\"what is tdd permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2><p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2776152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A study from 2017</a> found that only 12% of developers who claimed to do TDD, did actually follow it.

The role of the tests in TDD is to support building the software, whereas the role of tests in software testing is to break the software. Think of scaffolding instead of a wrecking ball.</p><p>TDD's tests can be thought of as a specification of the system's behavior, or as small examples of how the code works. In the software development life cycle, the TDD mindset focuses more on requirements and design than on verification, though the verification side is also important to support refactoring and adding new features.</p><p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"margin-bottom: 1rem;\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 920px; \"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/b17f8/tdd-vs-testing.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 62.60869565217391%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n          <source\n              srcset=\"/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/a0b58/tdd-vs-testing.webp 230w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/bc10c/tdd-vs-testing.webp 460w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/966d8/tdd-vs-testing.webp 920w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/445df/tdd-vs-testing.webp 1380w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/fad48/tdd-vs-testing.webp 1600w\"\n              sizes=\"(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px\"\n              type=\"image/webp\"\n            />\n          <source\n            srcset=\"/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/e83b4/tdd-vs-testing.jpg 230w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/e41a8/tdd-vs-testing.jpg 460w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/4d836/tdd-vs-testing.jpg 920w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/89b2d/tdd-vs-testing.jpg 1380w,\n/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/b17f8/tdd-vs-testing.jpg 1600w\"\n            sizes=\"(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px\"\n            type=\"image/jpeg\"\n          />\n          <img\n            class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n            src=\"/static/e6271d2d78d7a34d61af498816395c1a/4d836/tdd-vs-testing.jpg\"\n            alt=\"Photos of scaffolding around a building and a wrecking ball destroying a brick wall.\"\n            title=\"Photo credits: [Niklas Hamann](https://unsplash.com/photos/jAj0pjdzvic), [Rhys Asplundh](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rhysasplundh/5202454842)\"\n            loading=\"lazy\"\n            style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n          />\n        </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\"><p>Photo credits: <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/jAj0pjdzvic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Niklas Hamann</a>, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/rhysasplundh/5202454842\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rhys Asplundh</a></p></figcaption>\n  </figure></p><recommended-reading><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/interlude-basic-correctness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interlude: Basic Correctness</a> - discussion between a TDD and a software testing expert</li>\n</ul></recommended-reading><hr><p>Proceed to <a href=\"/2-design\">Chapter 2: Refactoring and design</a> or <a href=\"/exercises\">Exercises</a></p></div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/1-tdd","title":"Chapter 1: What is TDD","banner":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/esko/devel/tdd-mooc/data/1-tdd.md"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3294351120","994120085"]}
