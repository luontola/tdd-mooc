One of the books said that this is how you write programs: <em>You take the input tape, look at its contents, and type manually the output tape that you expect to create. Then programming is the process of writing a program until the actual output tape matches the expected output tape.</em></p>\n<p>Some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. And for two decades, the technique passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it was rediscovered.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 1990s. Kent Beck had followed in his father's footsteps and was now a software consultant. He had written the first unit testing framework in the xUnit family, SUnit for Smalltalk. It was then that Kent remembered the book he had read as a kid. <em>\"If I took this type-the-output-tape-first schema seriously, then I would write the test before I had the code.\"</em></p>\n<p>He thought the idea was stupid, so he had to try it.</p>\n<p>Kent tried it with a stack, and half an hour later he was hooked. All the anxieties he had felt while programming, which had been getting worse as experience accrued, just dropped away. <em>\"I'm not done until all the tests that I can imagine are all passing. But I don't have to make them all pass at once. I can just type one in and then make it work. And type the next one and make that work. Eventually... can I think of any other tests? No. I must be done.\"</em> He was completely relaxed.\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/tM1iOJsR7p4?t=2080\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[2]</a>\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/cGuTmOUdFbo?t=325\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[3]</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-tdd\" style=\"position:relative;\">What is TDD<a href=\"#what-is-tdd\" aria-label=\"what is tdd permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TSE.2017.2776152\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A study from 2017</a> found that only 12% of developers who claimed to do TDD, did actually follow it.

Every few minutes, in order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Red</strong>: Write a failing test. Predict (mentally or out loud) how the test should fail. Run the test. See it fail. If it failed in an unexpected way, check your assumptions. Improve the failure's readability.</li>\n<li><strong>Green</strong>: Make the test pass. ASAP. Commit any sins necessary. Hard-coded values. If statements. Fake it until you make it.</li>\n<li><strong>Refactor</strong>: Improve the design of the code, without changing its behavior. Atone for your sins. Remove duplication. Improve names. Minimal code which passes the current tests.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Repeat until there are no more tests to write/until bored.</p>\n<p>If the current design makes it difficult to make a new test pass, consider commenting out the new test and refactoring first. \"Make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change.\" <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KentBeck/status/250733358307500032\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">[1]</a></p>\n<p>As the tests get more specific, the implementation gets more generic.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2005/red-green-refactor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://www.jamesshore.com/v2/blog/2005/red-green-refactor</a>\n<a href=\"https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/12/17/TheCyclesOfTDD.html</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"test-list\" style=\"position:relative;\">Test list<a href=\"#test-list\" aria-label=\"test list permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h4>\n<p>To stay focused on the current test and phase, it's helpful to maintain a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ursenzler/status/1433096612088356866/photo/2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">test list</a> (on paper, a text file or as TODO comments in tests).</p>\n<p>Whenever you come up with an idea for a new test (e.g. a new feature or an edge case that needs to be covered), add it to your test list.

But in TDD, the \"tests\" are thought of as a specification of the system's behavior, or as small examples of how the code functions. The focus is more on requirements and design than on verification.</p>\n<p>The test names should be sentences which describe what the system should do - its behavior.</p>\n<p>Thought exercise: All production and test code has disappeared. The only thing remaining is the test names. Can someone reimplement the system, so that it will do pretty much the same things as before?</p>\n<p>When a test fails, look at the name of the test. There are three possibilities:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The system has a bug. Fix the implementation.</li>\n<li>The behavior is still needed, but the test needs updating. Change the test. Think of how to decouple the test from unrelated behaviors, to have fewer unwanted test failures.</li>\n<li>The behavior is no more needed. Delete the test.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://dannorth.net/introducing-bdd/</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Proceed to <a href=\"/2-design\">Chapter 2: Refactoring and design</a> or <a href=\"/exercises\">Exercises</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/1-tdd","title":"Chapter 1: What is TDD","banner":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/esko/devel/tdd-mooc/data/1-tdd.md"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3294351120","994120085"]}
