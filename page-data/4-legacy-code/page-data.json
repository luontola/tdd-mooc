There can be some false warnings, so going through the coverage report takes more time, but refactoring the code to avoid the false warnings can sometimes improve code quality. Even when the mutation coverage tool is smart about which tests to run for each mutation, it's typically an order of magnitude slower than running the tests normally: if the tests normally run in 1 second, measuring mutation coverage might take 1 minute.</p>\n<p>When writing tests for legacy code, code coverage can be helpful. See which lines are not covered and for each conditional, write test cases that cause the code to take both branches.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=204677</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"characterization-tests\" style=\"position:relative;\">Characterization tests<a href=\"#characterization-tests\" aria-label=\"characterization tests permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p><em>aka golden master, aka snapshot testing, aka approval testing.</em></p>\n<p>With legacy code, the source code is the truth, even when it contains bugs. The first priority is improving the code coverage, so that the code can be refactored safely.</p>\n<p>Write tests which just assert that the code <em>does what it does</em>. Understanding the code is not necessary for writing such tests; use code coverage to your advantage and make sure that every code path is executed.</p>\n<p>After the code is covered with characterization tests, it can be refactored, making it easier to understand what the code does. After you understand the code, it's easier to write more descriptive tests for it and begin changing what the code does.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/03/characterization-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/03/characterization-testing/</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxH9Lz0Ckg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxH9Lz0Ckg</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"exercise-4-testing-legacy-code\" style=\"position:relative;\">Exercise 4: Testing legacy code<a href=\"#exercise-4-testing-legacy-code\" aria-label=\"exercise 4 testing legacy code permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h1>\n<p>Clone the project <a href=\"https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata</a>.
