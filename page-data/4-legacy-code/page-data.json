The first priority is improving the code coverage, so that the code can be refactored safely.</p><p>Write tests which just assert that the code <em>does what it does</em>. Understanding the code is not necessary for writing such tests; use code coverage to your advantage and make sure that every code path is executed.</p><p>After the code is covered with characterization tests, it can be refactored, making it easier to understand what the code does. After you understand the code, it's easier to write more descriptive tests for it and begin changing what the code does.</p><recommended-reading><ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2007/03/characterization-testing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Understanding Legacy Code with Characterization Testing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OxH9Lz0Ckg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cutting Code Quickly: From 0% to Cleanly Refactored 100% Tested Code</a></li>\n</ul></recommended-reading><h2 id=\"fixing-bugs-test-first\" style=\"position:relative;\">Fixing bugs test-first<a href=\"#fixing-bugs-test-first\" aria-label=\"fixing bugs test first permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2><p>An excellent time and place for improving legacy code's test coverage is when there is a bug to fix. First write a test which reproduces the bug, and then fix it. Having a test which reproduces the bug makes it easier to fix it, and once the test is in place, you can be sure that the same bug will not reappear.</p><p>In the larger scope, this slowly improves the codebase as a whole. Bugs tend to cluster together, so by writing tests for them and refactoring those areas of the code, it reduces the risk of other bugs in the same area.</p><p>Also when adding new features, it's best to do it test-first. You can write the new code as an isolated component using TDD, and then change the legacy code to just delegate to the new code. Little by little you grow oases of safe areas that are easy to work with, and those will be in the areas of the codebase which change most often.</p><hr><p>Proceed to <a href=\"/5-advanced\">Chapter 5: Advanced techniques</a> or <a href=\"/exercises\">Exercises</a></p></div>","frontmatter":{"path":"/4-legacy-code","title":"Chapter 4: Legacy code","banner":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/esko/devel/tdd-mooc/data/4-legacy-code.md"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3294351120","994120085"]}
