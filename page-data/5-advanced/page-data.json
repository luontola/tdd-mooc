On top of good CI practices, CD requires comprehensive tests on multiple levels so that if all tests pass, you can trust that the software will work in production. Incomplete features must also be designed to be deployable to production, for example by hiding them with <a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">feature toggles</a> until they are complete.</p>\n<p>Continuous Delivery may include a human decision on <em>when</em> to deploy to production. If that decision is automated and every build which passes its tests is deployed to production automatically, then it's called <em>Continuous Deployment</em>.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"testing-in-production\" style=\"position:relative;\">Testing in production<a href=\"#testing-in-production\" aria-label=\"testing in production permalink\" class=\"anchor after\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a></h2>\n<p>When testing <em>before</em> production is topnotch and you practice Continuous Delivery, then it's possible to start testing <em>also</em> in production.

You need to have done your <a href=\"https://norvig.com/21-days.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">10 000 hours</a> to know what test-driven good code looks like, how to write testable code, and what tests are needed to test-drive a piece of code. The end result should look indistinguishable from whether it was written test-first or test-last.</p>\n<p><strong>Spike and stabilize:</strong> Write some experimental code to see if a thing could work. Cutting corners is okay. Test coverage might be lacking. Leave behind TODOs about things that are not of production quality. If the experiment doesn't work, the code can be thrown away. If the code proves useful, <em>then</em> you write the tests for it afterwards and refactor the code up to production quality. Looking at the end result, nobody should be able to tell that the code was <em>not</em> test-driven.</p>\n<p><strong>Ginger cake:</strong> The story behind the name is about a granny's recipe box. There is a recipe for chocolate cake, listing all the ingredients and instructions. Later in the box there is also a recipe for ginger cake, which reads just \"like chocolate cake, but with ginger\". As a software development pattern, this can be used when you need to build a new feature which is quite similar to something you've done before - and you <em>know the code intimately</em>. Copy-paste the old code, remove unnecessary parts and customize it suit the new feature.</p>\n<p>Read more:\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USc-yLHXNUg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USc-yLHXNUg</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Proceed to <a href=\"/6-afterword\">Chapter 6: To infinity and beyond</a> or <a href=\"/exercises\">Exercises</a></p>","frontmatter":{"path":"/5-advanced","title":"Chapter 5: Advanced techniques","banner":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/esko/devel/tdd-mooc/data/5-advanced.md"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3294351120","994120085"]}
