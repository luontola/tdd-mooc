Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative programming technique where you first write a failing test, which describes what you want to achieve, and after that write production code to pass the test. This course is too short for learning TDD - that will take about 6-12 months of practice - but hopefully it will help you to get over the initial hurdle of getting started with TDD, and prepare you for a journey of mastering TDD.

The following short video from [Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) explains why you should learn TDD:
