Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative programming technique where you first write a failing test, which describes what you want to achieve, and after that write production code to pass the test. This course is too short for learning TDD - that will take about 6-12 months of practice - but hopefully it will help you to get over the initial hurdle of getting started with TDD, and prepare you for a journey of mastering TDD.

You are ready for this course if you have no problems writing small applications of a few thousand lines of code. Some experience in writing web apps and using a database is recommended (one of the exercise projects is a small full-stack web app). The exercises are in JavaScript, but if you prefer, you may write the projects in any other language. As tools you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), an IDE or text editor, and a screen recording software (e.g. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)).

The following short video from [Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) explains why you should learn TDD:
