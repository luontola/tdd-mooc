## What?

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative programming technique where you first write a failing test, which describes what you want to achieve, and after that write production code to pass the test. This course is too short for learning TDD - that will take about 6-12 months of practice - but hopefully it will help you to get over the initial hurdle of getting started with TDD, and prepare you for a journey of mastering TDD.


## Why?

In the following short video, [Dave Farley](https://twitter.com/davefarley77) explains why you should learn TDD:

## Who?

You are ready for this course if you have no problems writing small applications of a few thousand lines of code.

To do the extended version of this course (4+1 cr), some experience in writing web apps and using a database is recommended: you will need to implement a small full-stack web app. To that end, you are expected to know (or learn quickly) the things that are covered in the courses [Full Stack (parts 0-5)](https://fullstackopen.com/en/), [DevOps with Docker (parts 0-2)](https://devopswithdocker.com/), [Tietokantojen perusteet](https://tikape.mooc.fi/)/[any SQL tutorial](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial.html).


## How?

This course consists of [six exercises](/exercises/) about using TDD, refactoring and writing tests. Exercise 5 (full-stack web app) is optional, but if you do it, you will get an extra credit. For that purpose, this course is visible as two course units:

* [Test-Driven Development (4 cr)](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/otm-adcdbb43-dc29-467b-b68d-f5f7bf13ea7d) - do just the basic exercises (#1-4, #6)
* [Test-Driven Development: Full Stack (1 cr)](https://studies.helsinki.fi/courses/cu/otm-6fd8f9b4-9566-449b-8668-d91b3134dbcf) - do also the full-stack exercise (#5)

The exercises are in JavaScript, but if you prefer, you may write the projects in any other language. To do the exercises, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and an IDE or text editor (e.g. [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)). To submit the completed exercises, you'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and a screen recording software (e.g. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)).
