## Walking skeleton

Getting all the various technologies working together in a new project is a big job. Unfamiliar technologies often require experimenting and fiddling. If you don't know how something should be used, it's hard to write a test for it.

The walking skeleton approach can help in this situation. The idea is to start with one end-to-end test against a system which is deployed to production(-like) environment. Then develop just the bare bones of the system, so that it'll contain the main architectural components.

At start the test could just send a "hello world" message which goes through the frontend, backend, database and back again to the frontend. Focus on just getting the end-to-end test passing and putting the architectural components together. Focused unit and integration tests are best added *after* you have created the architecture, when there are less unknowns.

Then when the end-to-end test passes through the whole architecture, you can start fleshing out the system. As the system grows, keep improving the end-to-end test along with it.
