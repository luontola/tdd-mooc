# Exercise 5: Conway's Game of Life

The assignment is to *write [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using TDD.* Write it as a command line application which takes as input (1) a pattern file in [RLE format](https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) and (2) the number of iterations to simulate, and then outputs the resulting pattern in RLE format after the specified number of iterations.

TODO: example RLE files for test data, link to OBS screen recording instructions

**Course artifact:** Video of you doing this exercise. Use a screen recording software (e.g. [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/)). Upload the video to YouTube (as unlisted video) and return a link to the video as the course artifact.
