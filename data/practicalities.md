## Enrollment and study credits

If you are a student in Finland, you may receive 4 or 5 study credits from completing this course. See the [enrollment instructions](/enrollment) for details. Receiving study credits requires completing the course [while the course is active](#course-duration).

For everyone, after completing and submitting all the exercises, you will receive a certificate (see [example](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/api/certificate/tdd-2022/en/818b05333d6adad5d36bcf7a4e4f4fbf)) that you can show off as a trophy. üèÖ You will receive the certificate even if the course is not active.


## Discord channel

Communication and study groups will happen remotely over [Discord](https://discord.com/). Join the course's Discord channel through https://study.cs.helsinki.fi/discord/join/tdd


## Course duration

The course will start on **Tuesday 17.1.2023 at 16:15** ([Europe/Helsinki timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/finland/helsinki)) in Discord `tdd_voice` channel with an information session (and the first study group if somebody already started doing the exercises).

The course will end on **Sunday 12.3.2023**. There is no exam, but only the exercises. Submit all your exercises before that date. If you want to receive study credits, remember to [enroll on the course](/enrollment/#enroll-on-the-course) before that date.


## Study groups

We will have study groups **every Tuesday at 16:15-18:00** ([Europe/Helsinki timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/finland/helsinki)) in Discord `tdd_voice` channel while the course is active.

There we will go through the exercises and it's an opportunity to receive feedback from your code. This could include code review, refactoring, pair or mob programming, ad-hoc exercises etc.

Preliminary agenda, will change based on what people joining the study groups have done:

## Exercises

Do the exercises at your own pace and use the `#tdd_general` Discord channel for peer help.

### Exercise submissions

Submit your completed exercises to **<https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/tdd-2023>**

When submitting there, you will need to provide a link to a GitHub repository with your solution to the exercise. If your repository is private, please add [luontola](https://github.com/luontola) as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository) to your private repository so that we can view it.


## Screen recording

For the *last exercise*, you will need to also create a *screen recording video* of when you do the exercise. It's kind of like the final exam of the course. You will not be rated based on how well you use TDD, only whether you use TDD or not.

The recordings may be used for research purposes to improve the course, to see how well this course manages to teach people TDD. If some of you would volunteer to record *all* of their exercises, that would be interesting research material as well.

It's [quite easy](https://obsproject.com/wiki/OBS-Studio-Quickstart) to do screen recording with [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) - all the kids on Twitch can do it, and so can you. You can upload the videos to a video streaming service of your choice.
